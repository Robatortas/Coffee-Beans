# Coffee Beans
Coffee Beans is a youtube downloader with a user interface.
It's easy to use, and unlike websites, it doesn't get you fucking malware.

Enjoy!

## Frequently Not Asked Questions
- Why is the name "Coffee Beans"?: <u>I don't fucking know man... I just like it.</u>
- Is it safe?: <u>Yes. You can check the source code for yourself, that is why it's open source.</u>

## Additional Stuff
I only made an executable for Windows, you don't need to install python to run this, just download it and enjoy.

If you want to run the application on Linux or Mac, you will need the following:

    - A Python installation : https://www.python.org/
    
    - Once you have Python installed on your machine, run the following commands on your terminal:
    
        pip install pytube
        pip install pysimplegui

And with that, you can just run the application by clicking on the "coffee_beans.py" file located on the "internal" folder.

## Help
